Implementation of Algorithms: 
The recent standard implementations of ASCON 128 and AES were utilized. For ASCON 128 V1.2 was used, while for AES [GCM using OPENSSL Crypto Library] was employed. 
Each algorithm was set up with its default configurations, which are widely recognized in the industry.
Preparation of Data:
Data sets ranging from 1,000 bytes to 1,000,000,000 bytes[1GB] were encrypted to evaluate performance across workloads. The data consisted of generated bytes to create an authentic and impartial input, for encryption tasks.
Measuring Time:
We noted the time taken for encryption and detailed the user and system times separately. This was done using timing tools[getrusage] that offer precise measurements in milliseconds.
Calculating Throughput: 
The throughput, measured in million bytes per second was determined by dividing the data size by the encryption time. This calculation allows for a comparison of the efficiency of different algorithms.

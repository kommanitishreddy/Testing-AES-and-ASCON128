Implementation of Algorithms: 
The recent standard implementations of ASCON 128 and AES were utilized. For ASCON 128 V1.2 was used, while for AES [GCM using OPENSSL Crypto Library] was employed. 
Each algorithm was set up with its default configurations, which are widely recognized in the industry.
Preparation of Data:
Data sets ranging from 1,000 bytes to 1,000,000,000 bytes[1GB] were encrypted to evaluate performance across workloads. The data consisted of generated bytes to create an authentic and impartial input, for encryption tasks.
Measuring Time:
We noted the time taken for encryption and detailed the user and system times separately. This was done using timing tools[getrusage] that offer precise measurements in milliseconds.
Calculating Throughput: 
The throughput, measured in million bytes per second was determined by dividing the data size by the encryption time. This calculation allows for a comparison of the efficiency of different algorithms.


Benchmark Objective:
The goal of the benchmark is to assess how ASCON and AES encryption techniques perform across data sizes. Performance is evaluated based on encryption time and throughput which measures the speed at which data can be encrypted per second.
Methodology Considerations:
•	The benchmarks were conducted using the hardware and software setup to maintain consistency.
•	Time measurements are recorded in Milliseconds with columns, for user and system time.
•	Throughput is quantified in millions of bytes per second indicating the efficiency of each algorithm.
•	User time signifies the duration that the CPU devotes to executing user related tasks while system time represents the period allocated to system/kernel operations.
